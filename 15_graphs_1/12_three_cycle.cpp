/*
Given a graph with N vertices (numbered from 0 to N-1) and M undirected edges, then count the distinct 3-cycles in the graph. A 3-cycle PQR is a cycle in which (P,Q), (Q,R) and (R,P) are connected by an edge.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains two space separated integers, that denotes the value of N and M.
Each of the following M lines contain two integers, that denote the vertices which have an undirected edge between them. Let us denote the two vertices with the symbol u and v. 
Output Format :
Print the count the number of 3-cycles in the given graph
Constraints :
0 <= N <= 100
0 <= M <= (N*(N-1))/2
0 <= u <= N - 1
0 <= v <= N - 1
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
3 3
0 1
1 2
2 0
Sample Output 1:
1
